## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Rust
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) *(optional, for container-based dev)*
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (fast Python package/dependency manager)
- `make`

---

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenforcode/galemind.git
cd galemind
```

2. **Compile the core engine (Rust):**

```bash
make
```

---

## 🧪 Model Examples

Model training and inference utilities are available in the `models/` directory.

### Setup for Python model training

1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

```bash
cd models
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

2. **Train a model using the CLI:**

```bash
train --epochs 5 --batch-size 64
```

> `train` is a Typer-based CLI tool for training a simple CNN on the MNIST dataset. The model will be saved as `digit_detector.pth`.
